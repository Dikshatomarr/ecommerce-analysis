## Process Summary

### 1. Excel â€“ Data Cleaning

- Verified column formats and ensured correct data types for date, numeric, and categorical fields
- Handled blanks and missing values for Gender, Location, and Age_Group
- Created derived columns like Purchase_Year/Month for time-series analysis

### 2. SQL â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed extensive SQL queries to derive:

**Key Metrics:**
- Total Transactions: 15,000+
- Unique Customers: ~9,000
- Net Revenue Range: â‚¹100M+ over one year

**Demographic Insights:**
- Age group 25â€“34 and 35â€“44 showed highest spending
- Gender split was balanced with a slight revenue skew toward female customers
- Delhi, Bangalore, and Mumbai were top-performing cities by revenue

**Product Category Insights:**
- Electronics and Clothing were the top two revenue-generating categories
- Home Decor had low volume but higher profit margins

**Discount Analysis:**
- Discounts used in over 60% of transactions
- Higher discounts did not always correlate with higher profits
- Campaigns like "Flash Sale" showed reduced profitability

**Purchase Channel Performance:**
- Online contributed the majority of revenue
- Offline purchases showed slightly higher average profit per order

**Seasonality:**
- Peak months: November and December (year-end surge)
- Slow months: February and July
- Q4 contributed over 35% of annual revenue

**Data Quality Checks:**
- Identified transactions with unusually high Net Amounts as potential outliers
- Detected negative values in Net Amount and Profit Impact in several transactions
  - Root cause: Discount amounts were greater than the Gross Amount
  - This indicates potentially misconfigured or excessive discounting logic
- Recommendation: Review discount strategy and pricing rules to prevent transactions resulting in financial loss


### 3. Power BI â€“ Dashboard Creation

Created an interactive dashboard featuring:

**Visuals:**
- KPI Cards for Total Revenue, Unique Customers, Transactions, Avg. Profit
- Line Chart for Monthly Revenue Trends
- Bar Chart for Product Category Performance
- Stacked Column for Discounted vs Non-discounted Revenue
- Pie Chart for Purchase Channel Share
- Map showing Revenue by Region
- Matrix comparing Discount Name vs Profitability by Category


## Key Insights

| Area               | Finding |
|--------------------|---------|
| Product Strategy   | Electronics had highest revenue but lower profit margins; Home Decor had better profit margins but lower volume |
| Discount Strategy  | Not all discounts contributed positively to profit; some high-usage discounts hurt profitability |
| Customer Segments  | Age group 25â€“44 generated the most revenue; marketing can be targeted toward this segment |
| Regional Sales     | Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore dominated revenue; smaller cities had higher profit per transaction |
| Channel Mix        | Online had highest volume; offline showed higher per-order profit |
| Seasonality        | Q4 (Octâ€“Dec) had the strongest sales; February had the lowest |

## Business Recommendations

- Refine discount strategy by identifying and eliminating high-cost/low-return campaigns
- Focus marketing on high-value age segments (25â€“44) and top-performing regions
- Upsell or bundle high-margin products like Home Decor with Electronics
- Boost campaigns during slow months (February, July) to stabilize revenue
- Enhance offline channel with personalized promotions, given higher average profit
